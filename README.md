## Examination criteria
Examination criteria will be based on 3 types of items: mandatory, forbidden and bonus points. 

Proper use/application/implementation of these will result in the best qualification, while 
improper application will subtract points. 

Sharing solutions/implementations/any code between training participants is strictly forbidden 
and will result in full point deduction for that requirement.

If you need help feel free to reach me through Teams.

## Mandatory
